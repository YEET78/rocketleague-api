This repository is no longer maintained. Due to the many updates that have occured during the time i have been away, and the changes to Rocket Leagues authentication.
Please look into using [https://github.com/yataknemogy/rocket-league-api] instead.


# rocketleague-api
A public breakdown of the parts of the Rocket league endpoints that I have found access to.
